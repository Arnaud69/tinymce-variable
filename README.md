# TinyMCE variable

TinyMCE variable is a plugin that makes it easier to work with variables in text.

## Why

I see a lot of companies that have the need for variables in their editors. Maybe one of the most popular is [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) ([merge tags](http://mailchimp.com/features/merge-tags/)), but non of these companies seems to solve this problem in a very usable way. Especially for non technical people I can imagine that seeing something like `*[FNAME|*` scares the sh*t out of them.

## Demo

[Demo example of this plugin](http://sitebase.github.io/tinymce-variable/)

## Features

* Replace variables like `{example}` with something more visual
* Variables are not editable
* Delete variables with one hit on the backspace button

## Develop
